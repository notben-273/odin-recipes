    <h2>Description</h2>
    This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother. 
    I have never seen another one quite like it! It will always 
    be my favorite and has won several first place prizes in 
    local competitions. It makes the perfect dessert for family 
    dinners or during the holidays, topped with whipped cream or 
    ice cream, or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour 
            and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 
            1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a 
            boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 
            9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will 
            overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into 
            eight 1-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a 
            slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and 
            evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the 
            center and shorter strips at the edges.</li>
        <li>Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips 
            all the way back so they're almost falling off the 
            pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly 
            over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the 
            first and third strips back into their original 
            position.</li>
        <li>Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay 
            one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over 
            top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into 
            their original position.</li>
        <li>Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips 
            of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as 
            necessary, and pinch to secure.</li>
        <li>Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over 
            lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced 
            apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it 
            doesn't run off the sides.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce 
            the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 
            continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 
            minutes.</li>
    </ol>
